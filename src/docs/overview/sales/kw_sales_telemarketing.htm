<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>KnowledgeWright Sales is a tool for capturing the expertise of your top sales, 
  pre-sales technical, and marketing people and deploying it on an as-needed basis 
  to your sales force.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>The problem with technical sales is that, no matter how technically sharp the 
  sales force might be, it is difficult to stay up technically while maintaining 
  the daily pressure of actual selling.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Technical benefits and feature relationships are maintained in a knowledgebase 
  that only provides the precise information needed for the situation of the moment. 
  The knowledgebase is used to dynamically script a dialog with the prospect, 
  asking for just the information that makes sense, and explaining benefits to 
  the prospect that are fine-tuned to his/her particular situation and needs.</p>
<p>In addition to dynamically generating a dialog, and explaining benefits, the 
  system generates a proposal for the next customer action.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Reduces the demand on pre-sales technical support staff.</li>
  <li>Gives sales force richer and deeper technical product knowledge as needed.</li>
  <li>Generates sales dialogs optimized as the top sales people would.</li>
  <li>Generates proposals dynamically targeted for each prospect.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>KnowledgeWright Sales is a tool for capturing the expertise of your top sales, 
  pre-sales technical, and marketing people and deploying it on your Web site.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>The problem with technical sales on the Internet is that a prospect must interpret 
  the product presentations and suitability of the product for his/her particular 
  situation. The valuable ability of a skilled sales person to map their needs 
  and situation to the benefits and features of the product is missing.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Technical benefits and feature relationships are maintained in a knowledgebase 
  that is used to dynamically generate a custom dialog with the user, probing 
  for needs and pattern-matching them against the benefits and features of the 
  system.</p>
<p>The prospect gets the sort of personal attention, and custom recommendations 
  that would normally only be achieved through direct human contact.</p>
<p>In addition to dynamically generating a dialog, and explaining benefits, the 
  system generates a proposal, clearly laying out what the prospect should do 
  next based on those needs and situation.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Reduces frustration of Web-site visitors.</li>
  <li>Allows precision presentation of sales benefits to Web-visitors.</li>
  <li>Provides links to the key parts of a Web-site that should be visited.</li>
  <li>Generates proposals dynamically targeted for each visitor.</li>
  <li>Saves log of interactive sessions, providing valuable marketing information.</li>
</ul>

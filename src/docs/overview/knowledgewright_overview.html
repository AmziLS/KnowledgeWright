<p>KnowledgeWright is an embeddable, extendable expert system and knowledge engineering 
  environment from Amzi!. It can be embedded in everything from web servers to 
  Visual Basic. The reasoning engine can be extended to accomodate a wide variety 
  of knowledge structures and reasoning algorithms. And KnowledgeWright has a 
  full graphical user interface for developing your own knowledgebases called 
  the Workshop.</p>

<h2><a name="overview"></a><font color="#990000">Expert System/Knowledgebase Overview</font></h2>
<p>Knowledgebases, also called expert systems, allow expertise of the few to be 
  disseminated to the many.</p>
<p>They do this by encoding an expert's knowledge in discrete, declarative 'chunks' 
  of knowledge, without the need for conventional programming. A reasoning engine 
  applies that knowledge to specific cases, very much the way a human expert would, 
  by having a dialog with the user.</p>
<p>Unlike other ways of disseminating knowledge, the user does not have to find 
  what they are looking for in a knowledge base. Instead, the reasoning engine, 
  using the knowledgebase, probes the user for information about a particular 
  situation as needed, and finds the appropriate recommendations for that user, 
  based on their situation.</p>
<p>For example, the diagnostic knowledge of a company's technical support people 
  can be stored in a knowledge base and deployed on the Web. A user dialog with 
  the reasoning engine would be very similar to a conversation with a technical 
  support person, and, if successful, the reasoning engine would tell the user 
  how to resolve the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Similarly, the sales expertise of a company could be encoded in a knowledgebase, 
  allowing visitors to a Web site to have the benefit of carrying out a dialog 
  with a reasoning engine that helps them find the right products for them.</p>
<p>These are two general examples, but there are many other advisor type, expert 
  system, knowledgebase applications. For example, a coaching software product 
  that has a knowledgebase for making workout recommendations, or insurance form 
  expert for helping file Medicare claims, or a job advisor on a work placement 
  website.</p>
<h2><a name="architecture"></a><font color="#990000">KnowledgeWright Architecture</font></h2>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = architecture>One of the major difficulties with building expert 
  system/knowledgebases is that the sort of non-precise knowledge that typifies 
  them varies widely from one problem domain to another. Further, the way in which 
  the knowledge is applied varies as well. And the expertise quite often requires 
  integration with other sources of information.</p>
<p>KnowledgeWright is designed to be easily molded to any sort of domain expertise, 
  type of reasoning, collection of supporting data, types of actions triggered, 
  and deployment. This means KnowledgeWright can be configured to provide a near-perfect 
  knowledge development, test, and deployment environment for a given domain of 
  expertise.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3><a name="jigs"></a>Jigs</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = jig>A particular molding of KnowledgeWright for a domain is 
  called a Jig. Its function is similar to its manufacturing counterpart, being 
  its a specialized tool for building a certain type of thing.</p>
<p>KnowledgeWright has a Basic Jig that is the foundation of the other jigs, and 
  provides generalized advice and problem solving expert system capabilities. 
  Other specialized jigs are available as well, and it is possible to create customized 
  jigs for particular situations.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h3><a name="knowledgebase"></a>Knowledgebase</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = knowledgebase>A Knowledgebase is composed of a number of different 
  types of knowledge objects. These objects contain the actual knowledge. Examples 
  of knowledge objects include: question objects, for asking the user questions; 
  rule set objects for expressing relationships; table objects similarly used; 
  and text objects for dynamically composing documents. Different jigs might support 
  different types of objects.</p>
<p>Each object has properties that define that object. For example, a question 
  has a &quot;prompt&quot; property which is the query to display to the user. 
  A text object, not surprisingly, has a &quot;text&quot; property which is the 
  document or a piece of a document.</p>
<h3><a name="workshop"></a>Workshop</h3>
<p>The Workshop is a graphical environment and contains both editing tools and 
  testing/debugging tools. These allow for the creating and maintenance of a knowledgebase, 
  and for the test execution of that knowledgebase.</p>
<p>The editing tools are driven by a schema describing the particular knowledge 
  objects used in a particular jig.</p>
<p>The test and debug tools make use of the particular reasoning strategy used 
  for a particular jig. They access that reasoning engine through a standard KnowledgeWright 
  API (Application Program Interface) that provides a uniform dialog for runtime 
  communication.<! AMZI_INDEX = KWI></p>
<h3><a name="runtime"></a>Runtime</h3>
<p>Because the knowledgebase and reasoning engine communicate via the standard 
  KnowledgeWright API, it is possible to have a variety of runtime deployment 
  options. A Web CGI interface and stand-alone Java and Visual Basic interfaces 
  are included with the package, as well as samples for how to embed KnowledgeWright 
  in applications written with other development tools.<! AMZI_INDEX = CGI; Visual Basic; Java></p>
<h2><a name="workshop"></a><font color="#990000">KnowledgeWright Workshop</font></h2>
<p>The Workshop provides a graphical environment for creating, editing, maintaining 
  and testing a knowledgebase. The editing environment is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="site_edit.png" width="862" height="623"></p>
<p>The screen shot shows a sample of a knowledgebase being developed with the 
  Basic Jig. Notice the trees on the left which can offer different organizational 
  views of the knowledgebase, and the knowledge object edit windows on the right.</p>
<p>You can run, test, and debug a knowledgebase from within the KnowledgeWright 
  Workshop. Here's a sample question dialog box from running a knowledbase in 
  the Workshop.</p>
<p><img src="site_question.png" width="444" height="392"></p>
<p>After gathering a bunch of information, the test runtime puts the solution 
  up. In this case, its actually a generated HTML document. You can see also the 
  status and trace windows that let you know how and what the reasoning engine 
  is doing.</p>
<p><img src="site_solution.png" width="862" height="623"></p>
<p>Here you see the answer to the 'goal' called &quot;main_doc&quot; which recommends 
  resources and products to a visitor to our Web site.</p>
<h2><a name="kwi"></a><font color="#990000">KnowledgeWright API</font></h2>
<p>Part of the KnowledgeWright architecture is a standard API (application program 
  interface) for communicating with a knowledbase, called the KWI. This makes 
  it easy for any application program to communicate with a conforming knowledgebase 
  and reasoning engine.</p>
<p>The nature of the API is relatively abstract, and defines a dialog between 
  a calling program and the reasoning engine. It basically allows the caller to 
  initiate problem solving and assert known information, and allows the reasoning 
  engine to report on results or specify actions to take, and to ask for further 
  information to be gathered as needed.</p>
<p>It is the KWI that makes it possible for the KnowledgeWright Workshop to test 
  run and debug knowledgebases developed with any pre-provided or custom built 
  KnowledgeWright Jigs.</p>
<p>The KWI is also used to implement the various runtime interfaces provided with 
  KnowledgeWright, including a stand-alone runtime and a Web-based interface. 
  Sample applications using the interfaces are provided for other application 
  programming environments.</p>
<h2><a name="runtimes"></a><font color="#990000">KnowledgeWright Runtimes</font></h2>
<p>The KWI makes it possible to provide a number of runtime environments for KnowledgeWright, 
  as well as make it easy to integrate KnowledgeWright components in other larger 
  application frameworks.</p>
<p>Runtimes distributed with the product include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A stand-alone runtime for running consultations.</li>
  <li>A Web-based runtime for deploying on the Web.</li>
  <li>Samples of runtimes for other application development environments (Java, 
    Delphi, Visual Basic, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="jigs"></a><font color="#990000">KnowledgeWright Jigs</font></h2>
<p>The KnowledgeWright product line has a number of pre-built jigs. We can build 
  custom jigs for you as well.</p>
<h3><a name="the_basic_jig"></a>The Basic Jig</h3>
<p>The Basic Jig is the foundation on which many other jigs can be built. It provides 
  a basic goal-seeking reasoning engine and can be used for a wide variety of 
  advisor-type applications. It includes knowledge objects for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rules and rules_tables, which define relationships,</li>
  <li>user questions and database queries, which are called to gather information 
    when needed,</li>
  <li>dynamic text, which can be used to dynamically construct output documents,</li>
  <li>formatting information, which control the look and feel of Web-based deployments, 
    and</li>
  <li>action items, which dictate actions a calling program should take, such 
    as send an e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasoning engine starts with one or more goals, and seeks to find values 
  for them. These can have simple values, or be complex text objects.</p>
<p>For example, the goal might be to find 'advice' and the value for advice is 
  determined by a number of rules, and those rules depend on asking questions 
  of the user and/or a database. Or, the goal might be to generate 'proposal' 
  where the proposal is a text object that is composed of dynamic entities whose 
  values are determined by rules which in turn ask questions, etc.</p>
<h3><a name="support_jig"></a>Support Jig</h3>
<p>The Support Jig recognizes that technical support people think of two types 
  of conditions in determining a resolution to a support problem. The first are 
  environment and release conditions, as a particular problem might occur in a 
  given release on a given operating system. The second are the actual diagnostic 
  symptoms used to determine the particular problem.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the 'solution' knowledge objects of the Support Jig separate these 
  two types of conditions. This makes it much easier to maintain a support knowledgebase 
  in the world of changing environments.</p>
<p>There are different types of advice that a 'solution' might entail, and the 
  knowledge objects recognize this as well. These include background information, 
  pointers to document, workarounds if its a bug, fixes if its not, etc.</p>
<p>Further the Support Jig includes the ability to e-mail the information gathered 
  from any session that did not resolve the user's problem, to the technical support 
  staff. </p>
<h2><a name="customization"></a><font color="#990000">Customized Features</font></h2>
<p>There are a number of ways in which KnowledgeWright Jigs can be customized 
  for a particular application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain Expertise - The way in which knowledge is represented and organized 
    can be customized for a given application domain.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reasoning - The reasoning that is applied to knowledge in a particular domain 
    can be customized.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Data Gathering - The facts for a particular situation that the reasoning 
    engine uses can be gathered from the user, external database, or any other 
    customized source of information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Action Triggers - The actions recommended can be simple text output, Web 
    pages, e-mail or any other sort of action you would like to customize.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Deployment - The working application can be deployed on the Web or stand-alone 
    or as part of a larger application.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, one customer wanted to provide detailed workout advice to athletes 
  based on a large number of physiological factors. The domain expert organized 
  the knowledge about the effects of each factor in tables, and wanted to see 
  those tables used in a cumulative, weighted way in determining a final workout 
  recommendation.</p>
<p>The custom prototype for that client was based on the Basic Jig, and included 
  additional knowledge objects for representing the physiological factors. These 
  'factor' objects contain the tables defining the effects of the factor, and 
  places to specify when the table will apply and how to weight the recommendations 
  of the table based on conditions.</p>
<p><img src="editor.png" width="862" height="739"></p>
<p>The reasoning engine incorporates a strategic layer that uses the Basic Jig 
  goal seeking behavior for getting what's needed for each factor, but then combines 
  the factors using a weighted average algorithm.</p>
<p>This particular application gathers information both from the athlete him/herself 
  and a database of workout history kept for the athlete by the calling program, 
  which in this case is a Visual Basic application.</p>

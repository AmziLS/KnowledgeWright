</h1><hr> <!-- #BeginEditable "Contents" --> <p>KnowledgeWright&reg; Support is 
designed specifically for creating tech support knowledgebases. The specialized 
tools for this application domain are called a <b>jig</b>. The 'Support' jig is 
a superset of the 'Basic' jig that provides general-purpose reasoning capabilities. 
Hence, you can use features of both jigs in your knowledgebases. <p>Knowledgebases 
are developed and tested using the Workshop. They are deployed using the various 
runtimes. We recommend you follow the documentation in the order listed. <ul>

Users &amp; Needed Skills</font></h2><p>KnowledgeWright is designed to be used 
by a wide range of computer users. Although some programming experience is very 
helpful, if you can expertly use spreasheets or databases, you already have many 
of the concepts needed to build knowledgebases.</p><p>If you want to deploy your 
knowledgebases on the web, you can use our ready-to-run web interface. No programming 
experience is necessary, but a basic understanding of how HTML and web servers 
work is required.</p><p>If you want to deploy your knowledgebases within another 
application, you will need solid experience with the programming environment you 
plan to use (Java, Visual Basic, C++, etc.).</p><h2><font color="#990000"><a name="support"></a>Support</font></h2><p>All 
users are welcome to free support from our <a href="http://www.amzi.com/support">Discussion 
Groups</a>. Academic and personal license users are encouraged to use this as 
their primary support method. Professional License users receive priority technical 
support via e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@amzi.com">support@amzi.com</a> and 
by telephone/fax as necesssary.<br> </p><p> We can also provide training and user 
application-specific support on a consulting basis.</p><p>Bug reports are welcome 
on either the discussion groups or via e-mail. Please provide adequate information, 
including test and log files, if necessary, to allow our developers to reproduce 
the bug.</p><p>Any and all comments on the software, documentation, samples, etc. 
are appreciated as well. </p><h2><font color="#990000"><a name="commerciallicense"></a>Purchasing 
a Professional or Enterprise License</font></h2><p>KnowledgeWright is free for 
90-day evaluation, academic and personal use. <a href="http://www.amzi.com/products/ordering_information.htm">Pricing 
and packaging information</a> is on our website. To order a professional version 
e-mail <a href="mailto:sales@amzi.com">sales@amzi.com</a> or fax the <a href="http://www.amzi.com/products/order_form.txt">order 
form</a> to +1-513-425-8025.</p><h2><font color="#990000"><a name="customjigs"></a>Custom 
Jigs (Reasoning Engines)</font></h2><p>KnowledgeWright has an internal architecture 
that makes it easy to build new reasoning engines that match the expert's domain. 
For example, we have built a jig that provides career advice and another that 
plans workouts for Olympic-class runners. These jigs are built at a fraction of 
the cost of a custom expert system shell because of KnowledgeWright's flexible 
architecture. See our website for details.</p><!-- #EndEditable --> <hr> <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Copyright.lbi" --><i><font size="-2">Copyright &copy;1996-2002 Amzi! inc. All Rights Reserved. Amzi!,

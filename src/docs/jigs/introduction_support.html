<p>A jig consists of two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The objects that comprise the knowledgebase.</li>
  <li>A process of reasoning over those objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are creating objects in the <a href="../workshop/workshop_manual.html">KnowledgeWright 
  Workshop</a>, you can press F1 to get the help detailed here.</p>
<h2><a name="knowledgebase_objects"></a><font color="#990000">Knowledgebase Objects</font></h2>
<p>The Support Jig is a reasoning engine that is designed for diagnosing problems 
  and presenting their solution. The primary object in the Support Jig is a <a href="support/object_solution.html">solution</a>. 
  A solution defines the environment the problem occurs in (operating system, 
  product version, etc.) and the precise conditions under which the problem occurs. 
  Included in each solution is a description of the problem and the workaround 
  or fix to it. Solutions can optionally include external actions to be taken, 
  such as to send an e-mail to tech support when a solution is not found.</p>
<p>The Support Jig also includes knowledge objects for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="support/object_knowledgebase.html">knowledgebase</a> itself 
    which defines the goals for reasoning,</li>
  <li><a href="basic/object_rule_set.html">rule sets</a> and <a href="basic/object_rules_table.html">rules_tables</a>, 
    which define relationships,</li>
  <li><a href="basic/object_fact.html">facts</a> which define fixed values</li>
  <li>user <a href="basic/object_question.html">questions</a>, <a href="basic/object_data_table.html">data_table</a> 
    queries and <a href="basic/object_sql.html">database queries</a>, which are 
    called to gather information when needed,</li>
  <li>dynamic <a href="basic/object_text.html">text</a>, which can be used to 
    dynamically construct output documents,</li>
  <li><a href="support/object_external_action.html">external actions</a>, which 
    dictate actions a calling program should take, such as send an e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects can be organized into <a href="basic/folders.html">folders</a>. Folders 
  have no effect on the reasoning process, they are simply an aid to knowledgebase 
  development. </p>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="reasoning_process"></a>Reasoning Process</font></h2>
<p>The reasoning engine starts with the list of all possible solutions and orders 
  them by the priority specified within each one. It then examines the environment 
  constraints and the conditions under which the problem occurs. If it needs additional 
  information, questions are asked of the user. The reasoning engines walks through 
  each solution looking for the ones that match. When found, the problem and its 
  resolution are displayed and any actions specified for that solution are taken.</p>

<p>KnowledgeWright Basic is a KnowledgeWright Jig that is a powerful tool by itself, 
  but that also provides the foundation for more specialized jigs. So understanding 
  it is key to understanding a number of jigs.</p>
<p>Any knowledgebase or expert system tool has rules of one form or another that 
  are applied to reason over the data gathered during a particular consultation 
  with the tool.</p>
<p>When looking at any knowledgebase or expert system tool, there are two key 
  factors that tell a lot about the system.</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>The way data used by the system is represented, and</li>
    <li>The reasoning strategy used to apply the rules to the data.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>As you might imagine, these factors can range from the simple to the complex 
  for any given tool. KnowledgeWright Basic is designed to be easy to work so 
  it opts for simple direct approaches for both.</p>
<h3><a name="data"></a>Data</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = data; fact>Data is represented as <b>fact = value</b> pairs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>color = &quot;blue&quot;
operating_system = &quot;Windows 98&quot;
Symptom = &quot;Screen is blank&quot;
quantity = 14
Problem = &quot;Screen saver on&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Names of facts begin with a letter and have no embedded spaces (otherwise they 
  must be quoted in single quotes).</p>
<p>Values can be either text strings enclosed in &quot;&quot; or numbers.</p>
<p><b>Fact = value</b> pairs are the fundamental building blocks of a KnowledgeWright 
  Basic knowledge base.</p>
<h3><a name="rules_and_questions"></a>Rules &amp; Questions</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = rule; question>Consider a simple technical support application. 
  The problem is the user's screen is blank and doesn't know what to do. The solution 
  depends on whether the video monitor is turned off, or the screen saver has 
  kicked in. Rules for this system might be:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>#1: if
   symptom = &quot;Screen is blank&quot; and
   led_light = &quot;on&quot;
then
   problem = &quot;Screen saver on&quot;

#2: if
   symptom = &quot;Screen is blank&quot; and
   led_light = &quot;off&quot;
then
   problem = &quot;Turned off&quot; </pre>
</blockquote>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = conditions>These rules are checking for the values of some 
  facts on the <b>if</b>, or <b>conditions</b>, side of the rules, and setting 
  the value of another fact on the <b>then, </b>or<b> action</b>, side of the 
  rules.</p>
<p><i>Note - In the actual KnowledgeWright rule editor, you enter the conditions 
  and actions for a rule in a tabular format, rather than in an if-then syntax 
  as above.</i></p>
<p>In addition to rules, some facts get their values simply by asking the user. 
  In KnowledgeWright you would specify those facts something like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>question symptom
   prompt = &quot;What is the symptom of your problem&quot;
   menu = &quot;Screen is blank&quot;, &quot;other&quot;

question led_light
   prompt = &quot;What is the state of the LED light?&quot;
   menu = &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Note - In the actual KnowledgeWright editor, questions have more options 
  that can be specified</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="reasoning"></a>Reasoning</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = goal-driven>KnowledgeWright Basic uses what is called <b>goal-driven</b> 
  reasoning. This means it starts with the goal of finding the value for a particular 
  fact.</p>
<p>In the case of the example above, the goal of the system is to determine the 
  value of the fact <b>problem</b>.</p>
<p>So the reasoning engine would look to see if there are any rules that can be 
  used to find a value for <b>problem</b>. It would find the first of the rules 
  above and note that in order to use that rule, it needs to know the value for 
  the fact <b>symptom</b>.</p>
<p>So now it gives itself a new goal, which is to find the value of <b>symptom</b>. 
  There are no rules for <b>symtpom</b>, so it would look to see if there was 
  another way to get a value. Finding a question for <b>symptom</b>, it would 
  use that to ask the user.</p>
<p>Now, depending on the value of symptom, it may or may not have to find a value 
  of <b>led_light</b>. If the user answered <b>other</b> for symptom, then our 
  rules don't apply and our user will be out of luck.</p>
<p>But if the user answered <b>Screen is blank</b>, then our rules might apply 
  so the reasoning engine will give itself the sub-goal of finding a value for 
  <b>led_light</b>. Again, there are no rules, but it finds a question specification 
  and uses that to ask the user.</p>
<p>Now with the sub-goals of <b>symptom</b> and <b>led_light</b> solved, it can 
  proceed to find a value for the original goal, <b>problem</b>.</p>
<h3><a name="running"></a>Running</h3>
<p>Here's a dialog a user might have with our simple system:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>
goal problem

What is the symptom of your problem?
(Screen is blank, other)

Screen is blank

What is the state of the LED light?
(on, off)

on

answer, problem = Screen saver on
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="adding_deeper_rules"></a>Adding Deeper Rules</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = rule>We might prefer to tell the user what to do, once we've 
  found out the problem, rather than just state the problem. So we might add some 
  rules like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>#1: if
   problem = &quot;Screen saver on&quot;
then
   action = &quot;Move the mouse&quot;

#2: if
   problem = &quot;Turned off&quot;
then
   action = &quot;Turn the monitor on&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We would now run our system with the goal <b>action</b>.</p>
<p>The reasoning engine would find these rules for <b>action</b>, and determine 
  it needed to first find a value for <b>problem</b>. And then it would work as 
  above, looking for the <b>problem</b>.</p>
<p>Because of the goal seeking nature of the system, and how rules link to other 
  rules based on those goals, you can represent both simple and quite complex 
  diagnostic or advice giving applications with KnowledgeWright Basic.</p>
<h3><a name="adding_broader_rules"></a>Adding Broader Rules</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = rule>The advantage of a rule-based system like KnowledgeWright 
  Basic, is that you can add additional knowledge to the system without programming. 
  So we could increase the knowledge in the tech support system by adding these 
  rules:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>#3: if
   symptom = &quot;Mouse doesn't track well&quot; and
   rollers_clean = &quot;no&quot;
then
   problem = &quot;Dirty rollers&quot;

#4: if
   symptom = &quot;Mouse doesn't track well&quot; and
   rollers_clean = &quot;yes&quot;
then
   problem = &quot;Mouse is broken&quot;

#3: if
   problem = &quot;Dirty rollers&quot;
then
   action = &quot;Clean the rollers of your mouse&quot;

#4: if
   problem = &quot;Mouse is broken&quot;
then
   action = &quot;Buy new mouse&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We would also add the &quot;Mouse is broken&quot; symptom to our list of symptoms we 
  can ask about, and a question about whether the rollers have been cleaned recently.</p>
<p>The reasoning engine will only ask the user for values of facts that it needs. 
  So if the user's symptom is the faulty mouse, then the engine will not need 
  to ask the user about the LED light. Likewise, if the symptom is the blank video 
  screen, then the user will not be asked about mouse rollers being clean.</p>
<p>A trace of how the reasoning proceeds would look like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>goal action
   considering first rule for action (move mouse)
      subgoal problem
         considering first rule for problem (screen saver)
            subgoal symptom
               asking user symptom
            found symptom = &quot;Mouse doesn't track well&quot;
         first rule for problem doesn't apply (screen saver)
         second rule for problem doesn't apply (turned off)
         considering third rule for problem (dirty rollers)
            subgoal rollers_clean
               asking user rollers_clean
            found rollers_clean = &quot;no&quot;
      found problem = &quot;Dirty rollers&quot;
   first rule for action doesn't apply (move mouse)
   second rule for action doesn't apply (turn on)
   considering third rule for action (clean rollers)
found action = &quot;Clean the rollers...&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="text"></a>Text</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = text>KnowledgeWright Basic also supports text objects, which 
  allow for relatively large chunks of text to be the values of facts. So you 
  might have a text object like:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>text clean_mouse
Clean your mouse by taking off the
plate on the bottom and ... </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the directions on how to clean your mouse. It could be used as the 
  value of one of the rules, so instead of</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>action = &quot;Clean the rollers of your mouse&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>you would have</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>action = clean_mouse</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the user would get the more detailed information about cleaning mouse rollers.</p>
<h3><a name="dynamic_text_generation"></a>Dynamic Text Generation</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = dynamic text>Text objects can also be dynamically generated 
  by taking advantage of the goal-seeking behavior of the reasoning engine. That 
  is, a text object can be made up of the values of other facts.</p>
<p>For example, our tech support system might want to present the user with a 
  document explaining the situation. It could do that like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><b>text: final_report</b>
The system has determined that the
problem is %problem%.
The action(s) you should take to fix
the problem are: %action%.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The %%s indicate that the reasoning engine should find values for those facts 
  and to put the values in the text at the indicated places.</p>
<p>Now you can give the system the goal of finding a value for <b>final_report</b>. 
  The reasoning engine would then locate the text object for <b>final_report</b> 
  and notice that it has to get a values for problem and action. It would then 
  proceed as before, and at the end display to the user the constructed value 
  of <b>final_report</b>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>The system has determined that the
problem is dirty rollers.
The action(s) you should take to fix
the problem are:
Clean your mouse by taking off the
plate on the bottom and ....</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="the_web"></a>The Web</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = HTML>Of course, the text objects 
  can all contain HTML for deployment on the Web. But this is enough talk, its 
  time to start playing with the system.</p>

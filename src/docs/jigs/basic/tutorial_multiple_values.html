<p><! AMZI_INDEX = multiple values; menu_multiple_choices>The facts we've seen so 
  far have single values. And those values have typically been text.</p>
<p>It is also possible to let a fact have multiple values. This decision affects 
  certain types of knowledge objects. Those are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>questions, where the user can enter multiple choices, and</li>
  <li>rule_sets, where multiple rules might apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>To change the diagnostic system so that it can handle multiple problems at 
  once, make the following changes:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Edit <b>question</b> <i>symptom</i> so that the question_type is menu_multiple_choices.</li>
    <li>Edit the <b>rule_set</b>s for <i>action</i> and <i>problem</i>, so that 
      the type is multiple_values. Change all of the '=' to 'include'. This is 
      needed because facts with multiple values are lists. There are special operators 
      to check the contents of a list such as include, exclude and number_of_items. 
      The '=' operator is used to check the entire contents of the list, e.g. 
      colors = [red, white, blue].</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>Run the system as before, only this time choose both symptoms when asked.</p>
<p>Notice that the system will now ask as many questions as it needs to find all 
  the problem(s) that apply.</p>
<p>Notice that the <i>problem_report</i> has all of the problems and actions listed.</p>
<p>As before, trace the execution of the system to understand how it works.</p>

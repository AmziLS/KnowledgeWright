<h3>The second &quot;hello&quot; application</h3>
<p>samples/basic/tutorial/hello_2</p>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = text; goals; hello>Now it's time to make hello smarter with 
  a text object. Text objects have textual values that can have embedded goals 
  in them. So, instead of a simple-valued fact for hello, this time we'll use 
  a text object that has the embedded goal of putting your name in the message.</p>
<h3>Set the goal hello &amp; create the text object 'hello'</h3>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new knowledgebase called hello_2.</li>
    <li>Edit the <b>knowledgebase</b> object, <i>main</i>, to set the goal to 
      hello, as in the hello_1 sample.</li>
    <li>Create a new <b>text</b> object, called <i>hello</i>, using the Object/New 
      menu.</li>
    <li>In the field labeled text, enter &quot;Hello %name%, welcome!&quot;, only 
      this time without the &quot;s. You don't need to enter the &quot;s in fields 
      that are known to only contain textual values, as opposed to numbers.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><img src="hello_2a.png" width="698" height="579"></p>
<p>The %name% is the embedded goal. It means, don't actually provide a value for 
  this text object until we've satisfied the goal <b>name</b>, and put that value 
  in the text string.</p>
<h3>Create the question 'name'</h3>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = question>How do we find a value for the goal <b>name</b>? Well, 
  let's ask the user. To do that we create a question object.</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new <b>question</b> object and name it <i>name</i>.</li>
    <li>Pick the type, fill_in_the_blank. Notice the fields change.</li>
    <li>Select an answer type of text, and a length of a good length.</li>
    <li>Fill in the prompt field with: &quot;What is your name?&quot;, without 
      the &quot;s.</li>
    <li>Save &amp; close the question object.</li>
    <li>Save the knowledgebase.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h3>Run it</h3>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Select run/run</li>
    <li>Notice that you are immediately asked your name. Enter it.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>We can look at more detail of the four panels presented here.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Upper Left - The current state of the system, including the unsolved goals 
    (probably none, represented as [], at the end), and what is known.</p>
  <p>Lower Left - A trace of the reasoning process. Note the interruption as the 
    user is asked a question.</p>
  <p>Upper Right - The goal.</p>
  <p>Lower Right - The output values of the goal.</p>

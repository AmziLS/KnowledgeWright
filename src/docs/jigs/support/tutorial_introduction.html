<p>KnowledgeWright Support is a KnowledgeWright Jig that is specifically designed 
  to find a solution that matches the user's problem. It is ideal for a wide range 
  of support problems including software support, hardware problem diagnosis and 
  common problem resolution..</p>
<p>KnowledgeWright Support includes all the powerful features of KnowledgeWright 
  Basic. This provides a variety of ways to specify multiple levels of rules, 
  access data from internal or external tables, use sophisticated document formatting 
  and much more. Please see the <a href="tutorial_introduction.html">Support 
  Tutorial Introduction</a> for a more information on these capabilities.</p>
<p>When looking at any knowledgebase or expert system tool, there are two key 
  factors that tell a lot about the system.</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>The way data used by the system is represented, and</li>
    <li>The reasoning strategy used to apply the rules to the data.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>The Support Jig extends the data representations available in the Basic Jig 
  by adding solution and external_action objects, and changes the reasoning strategy 
  by focusing on finding a matching soltuion object as a goal.</p>
<h3><a name="solutions"></a>Solution Objects</h3>
<p> 
  <! AMZI_INDEX = solution>
  The foundation of the Support Jig are solution objects. Each solution consists 
  of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The priority of this solution. The reasoning engine examines higher priority 
    solutions first. In general you want more common or more general problems 
    to be examined first.</li>
  <li>The environment this solution applies to. For software support, this may 
    be an operating system name/version and a product component and version. For 
    hardware support, this may be a model number or a component name.</li>
  <li>The conditions this solution applies to. These are the circumstances under 
    which this solution applies. For software, this might be the error message 
    or problem type. For hardware, it can be the status of certain indicators 
    (e.g. lights) or symptoms of the problem.</li>
  <li>A description of the problem to display to the user.</li>
  <li>The fix or solution of the problem to display to the user.</li>
  <li>A list of actions to perform when this solution is selected by the reasoning 
    engine. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="external_action_objects"></a>External_Action Objects</h3>
<p> 
  <! AMZI_INDEX = external_action>
  Since support systems can rarely answer every user's problem, most systems need 
  to forward unsolved problems to human technical support personnel. The external_action 
  object provides the ability to do this. External actions are implemented by 
  the calling program, whether it be a CGI interface, JSP/ASP or Java, Delphi 
  or Visual Basic application. The CGI interface implements an external action 
  to send an email.</p>
<h3><a name="reasoning"></a>Reasoning</h3>
<p> 
  <! AMZI_INDEX = goal-driven; reasoning engine>
  KnowledgeWright Support uses what is called <b>goal-driven</b> reasoning. This 
  means it starts with the goal of finding a solution object that matches the 
  user's environment and problem conditions.</p>
<p>The reasoning engine starts by making a list of all the solutions in the knowledgebase 
  and puts them in priority order, with the ones with the lowest priority coming 
  first and those with the highest priority coming last.</p>
<p>Starting with the first solution, it first tries to determine if the environment 
  conditions are true. So the goal of the system is to prove the first environment 
  condition. For example, if the environment condition is printer_type = &quot;inkjet&quot;, 
  now the first sub-goal of the system is to determine a value for printer_type. 
</p>
<p>First it looks to see if there is a fact named printer_type. If not, then it 
  would look for rule_sets or rules_tables that can provide a value for printer_type. 
  If not, then it would look for a question named printer_type that it can ask 
  the user.</p>
<p>(In the case of rule_sets or rules_tables, additional sub-goals may need to 
  be proven. This can lead to a very sophisticated reasoning process. See the 
  Basic Jig for details on this.)</p>
<p>Provided there is a question for printer_type, and the user enters &quot;inkjet&quot; 
  then the reasoning engine goes on to the next environment condition until all 
  of them have been proven. Once the environment matches, the reasoning process 
  works its way through all the conditions. If at any time an environment or condition 
  does not match, that solution is removed from the list of possible solutions, 
  and the reasoning process starts again with the next solution.</p>
<h3><a name="the_web"></a>The Web</h3>
<p> 
  <! AMZI_INDEX = HTML; web>
  Of course, the text objects can all contain HTML for deployment on the Web. 
  But this is enough talk, its time to start playing with the system.</p>

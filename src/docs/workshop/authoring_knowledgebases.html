<h2><a name="starting_the_knowledgebase_developer"></a><font color="#990000">Starting 
  the Knowledgebase Workshop</font></h2>
<p>Under Windows, double-click on 'kw.bat' in your installation directory. Under 
  Linux/Solaris type 'kw'.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="opening_a_knowledgebase"></a>Opening a Knowledgebase</font></h2>
<p>
  <! AMZI_INDEX = knowledgebase | open>
  There are two ways to open a knowledgebase for editing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open an existing knowledgebase</li>
  <li>Create a new knowledgebase</li>
</ul>
<p>Both options are available on the 'Knowledgebase' menu. Once a knowledgebase 
  is opened a tabbed pane will appear on the left side. The 'Object View' shows 
  all the objects in the knowledgebase sorted by object type. The 'Folder View' 
  shows all the objects sorted by folder. Only one knowledgebase can be opened 
  for editing at a time.</p>
<h2><a name="creating_and_editing_objects"></a><font color="#990000">Creating 
  and Editing Objects</font></h2>
<p>
  <! AMZI_INDEX = object view; folder view; Object | New>
  You can create and edit objects from either the 'Object View' or 'Folder View' 
  by double-clicking on the object name. A form will open to display all the properties 
  of the object. The following types of fields are used to edit the properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text Boxes: Allows the entry of multiples lines of text.</li>
  <li>Text Lines: Allows the entry of a single line of text.</li>
  <li>List: Allows the entry of an ordered list of items. The 'Add' button adds 
    the item in the box to the list. 'Delete' removes the highlighted item from 
    the list. The up and down arrows move the selected item up and down within 
    the list.</li>
  <li>Table: Allows the entry of items in a row and column format. You can move 
    columns by dragging the column header left or right. Rows and columns can 
    be added or deleted via the 'Row' and 'Column' menus. Columns can be renamed 
    via the 'Column' menu.</li>
  <li>Text Box Table: Allows the entry of multiple lines of text in each cell. 
    The column names and positions are fixed, however, the 'Row' menu can be used 
    to add and delete rows.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="right_mouse_button"></a>Right Mouse Button</h3>
<p>When you are editing in text boxes or text lines, the right mouse button has 
  2 special functions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Make Link - This turns the currently highlighted word or words into a link 
    (surrounded by percents (%)).</p>
  <p>Open Object - This opens the object named in the link where the mouse pointer 
    is. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="managing_folders"></a><font color="#990000">Managing Folders</font></h2>
<p>Folders let you organize your objects into a tree structure that fits your 
  knowledgebase's application. You can create, rename, delete and move folders 
  with the 'Folder' menu. You can also move objects between folders with the 'Object' 
  menu. To perform these operations, first highlight one or more objects or folders, 
  then select the command from the menu. </p>
<h3><a name="right_mouse_button"></a>Right Mouse Button</h3>
<p>If you right click on an object in the tree, the menu of actions that can be 
  performed is displayed.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="finding_things"></a>Finding Things</font></h2>
<h3><a name="find_text"></a><img src="../images/find.gif" width="20" height="20"> 
  Find </h3>
<p> 
  <! AMZI_INDEX =search | find>
  The Search | Find command will locate text anywhere it appears in the knowledgebase. 
  Each instance is displayed in the tabbed status window at the bottom of the 
  screen. </p>
<h3><a name="replace"></a><img src="../images/replace.gif" width="20" height="20"> 
  Replace</h3>
<p>When you rename an object, you are given the option of replacing all occurances 
  of the old object name with the new one. When this is done, a list of all the 
  replacements is displayed under this tab in the status window.</p>
<h2><a name="analyzing_knowledgebase_structure"></a><font color="#990000">Analyzing 
  Knowledgebase Structure</font></h2>
<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Product.lbi" -->
KnowledgeWright
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> provides 
two tools to assist you in building knowledgebases. These are displayed in a tabbed 
status window at the bottom of the screen. 
<h3><a name="object_connections"></a><img src="../images/web.gif" width="20" height="20"> 
  Object Connections</h3>
<p>The web icon shows you how any object is connected to other objects. Select 
  the object type and name from the center column. On the left you will get a 
  list of all the objects that use that object. On the right you will get a list 
  of all the objects that object uses.</p>
<h3><a name="structural_problems"></a><img src="../images/exclaim.gif" width="20" height="20"> 
  Structural Problems</h3>
<p>The red exclamation mark tells you about inconsistencies and circular loops 
  in your knowledgebase. It lists these things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects that have been defined, but are not used by any other object.</li>
  <li>Objects that are referenced in another object, but have not been defined.</li>
  <li>Values for objects that are: 1) not found in the choice list for the question 
    or 2) are the wrong type (i.e. a number instead of text).</li>
  <li>Circular loops in your rules, where a rule eventually ends up calling itself. 
    Such loops mean the reasoning engine can never find a solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="using_the_keyboard"></a><font color="#990000">Using the Keyboard</font></h2>
<p>All the menu items have mnemonic keys that can be pressed inconjunction with 
  Alt key to invoke that item. The most commonly used commands also have accelerator 
  keys that are listed to the right of the menu item.</p>
<p>For each environment (Windows &amp; Unix), the Workshop uses the default Look 
  &amp; Feel as determined by the Java runtime. The standard key assignments can 
  be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/swing/doc-files/Key-Index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/swing/doc-files/Key-Index.html</a>. 
  The following entries will probably be of the most interest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JMenuBar, JMenu and JMenuItem -- for navigating menus.</li>
  <li>JTree -- for using the Object and Folder trees.</li>
  <li>JTextField, JTextArea -- for editing single line and multi-line text boxes 
    in KnowledgeWright objects.</li>
  <li>JTable -- for using tables when editing KnowledgeWright objects.</li>
  <li>JList -- for selecting items in list boxes when editing KnowledgeWright 
    objects.</li>
  <li>JDesktopPane, JInternalFrame-- for managing the various open windows within 
    the Workshop.</li>
</ul>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="preferences"></a>Preferences</font></h2>
<p>The Tool | Preferences command lets you customize how the Workshop runs. You 
  can specify the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Web Browser Path</b>: The pathname of the web browser you want to use 
    to view help. </li>
  <li><b>Run Log Detail</b>: The default detail level for the log when running 
    your knowledgebases.</li>
  <li><b>Auto-Update Status Window</b>: Whether or not the status window is updated 
    to show the connections for the currently open object and to check if there 
    are problems in your knowledgebase.</li>
  <li><b>Save kb files in Unicode Format</b>: Whether or not kb files are saved 
    in Unicode format which fully supports the use of multiple international characters 
    and fonts. Under some versions of Windows (except NT, 2000 and XP) and most 
    versions of Unix/Linux, you will be unable to view/edit knowledgebases in 
    regular text editors when this option is enabled.</li>
  <li><b>Locale</b>: The Java Locale to use. This setting affects the use of the 
    keyboard, fonts and perhaps display, but it does not change the language for 
    the Workshop menus and forms.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="starting_the_debugger"></a><font color="#990000">Starting the Debugger</font></h2>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = run | run ; run | single step ; run ; single step>To run a 
  knowledgebase, select Run | Run or Run |Single Step from the main menu. This 
  will open up two windows. On the left is the current state of the reasoning 
  process and a log of its progress. On the right is a window that will display 
  the output for the user, both questions and all output.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="run_vs_single_step"></a>Run vs. Single Step</font></h2>
<p>You can choose either to run the knowledgebase, in which case it will run until 
  all solutions have been found. Or, you can step through the reasoning process, 
  pausing after each set of actions has been processed.</p>
<p>The reasoning engine uses the facts and the rules in the knowledgebase to determine 
  what other facts need to be obtained from the user. For each fact, a dialog 
  box will appear asking you to enter a value. As the reasoning engine proves 
  its goals, the solutions are displayed in the right hand window.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000"><a name="log_detail_level"></a>Log Detail Level</font></h2>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = run | log detail ; log ; execution log>You can control the 
  level of detail displayed in the execution log by selecting Run | Log Detail 
  then Low, Medium or High. You need to select the detail level before running 
  your knowledgebase.</p>
<h2><a name="compiling_knowledgebases"></a><font color="#990000">Compiling Knowledgebases</font></h2>
<p><! AMZI_INDEX = compiling ; run | compile ; kbc>Knowledgebases can be compiled 
  for execution within the Workshop or under any other environment, including 
  the Web. Compiled knowledgebases have these advantages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They run faster than interpreted (source code) knowledgebases.</li>
  <li>The contents of the knowledgebase cannot be read by your users.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compiled knowledgebases end in the suffix '.kbc'. To compile a knowledgebase 
  select the Run | Compile command.</p>
<p>When running (or single stepping) your knowledgebase in the Workshop, the compiled 
  version will be used if it is more recent than the source code version (.kb).</p>
<p>You can also open a compiled knowledgebase in any of the runtimes by specifying 
  the knowledgebase name with a .kbc suffix. As with the Workshop, if both source 
  and compiled versions are present, the compiled version will be used only if 
  it is more recent.</p>

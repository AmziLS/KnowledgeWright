Java Servlet to process both user inputs and knowledgebase outputs in national 
languages.</li></ul><h3></h3><h3>Version 4-2-0</h3><ul> <li>Final touches to documentation 
and samples.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-28</h3><ul> <li>Fixed compiler.</li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-28</h3><ul> <li> Fixed bug that hangs the workshop when deleting objects.</li><li>Fixed 
various bugs in the Workshop that generated Java errors when clicking on unrecognized 
items.</li><li>In the KWI before creating a new session, the session id must be 
'kw_init' not 0.</li><li>When using the KWI to assert facts, pass them all as 
strings and let the KWI convert them into the proper types (for all the runtime 
interfaces: Java, Delphi, VB).</li><li>Fixed the Java Servlet to use the charset 
in the main knowledgebase object, and improve error handling.</li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-27</h3><ul> <li>Fixed 'bad_initialization_parameters' bug in CGI.</li><li>Add 
results logging to CGI interface.</li><li>Fixed table editing of expanded rows 
for large tables.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-26</h3><ul> <li>Added Java servlet 
runtime.</li><li>Added Copy command on the Object menu to duplicate an object.</li><li>Added 
pop-up menu for knowledgebase tree for Edit, Rename, Delete, Copy and Move.</li><li>Added 
Print Log button to knowledgebase run.</li><li>Improve table editing by removing 
one set of scroll bars, and adding a Row | Expand All command to expand all the 
cells in the rule_set table.</li><li>Make Unicode an optional format for knowledgebases. 
Unicode should be enabled when using multiple character sets in the same knowledgebase.

programming techniques to improve efficiency and add new capabilities.</li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-25</h3><ul> <li> Added charset to knowledgebase object for use with the Web. 
The charset specifies the character set designation to be sent to the webserver 
for a KnowledgeWright application. For example, if you are using Chinese characters 
you will probably use 'big5'. Also fixed the CGI interface to properly convert 
all text and fact names/values in KnowledgeWright between Unicode and the language 
in the Window's locale setting.</li><li>Fixed an internal problem with the sorting 
of knowledgebase objects that causes the Workshop to hang and/or GPF.</li><li>Do 
a better job of garbage collection when closing a knowledgebase.</li><li>Don't 
check the integrity of a knowledgebase when opening it if auto-update of the status 
window is off. This improves performance when working with large knowledgebases. 
</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-24</h3><ul> <li> Added new data_table object that can 
be queried with the find() function like a SQL object queries an ODBC database.</li><li>Renamed 
table objects to rules_table.</li><li>Expanded the documentation.</li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-23</h3><ul> <li> Use Unicode files for knowledgebases, sessions and logs to

object to support the input of dates in different formats. Fixed bugs in questions 
for answer_type date.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-22</h3><ul> <li> Fixed the CGI 
interface to &quot;back-up&quot; properly under IIS/PWS (and any web server) by 
retracting all the user's answers following the ones on the screen the user backed 
up to and resume the reasoning process from there.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-21</h3><ul> 
<li> Supports international characters in knowledgebases.</li><li>Added Support 
Jig to the base product.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-20</h3><ul> <li>Allow the run 
process to be driven entirely from the keyboard without mouse clicks, and allow 
double-clicking on the menu to select and continue.</li><li>Fixed X (close) button 
to do nothing during run on the question dialog boxes.</li><li>Fixed confirmation 
about saving an object where just one table cell is modified.</li><li>Allow two 
variables to be used next to each other, e.g. %server%%path%.</li><li>Fix renaming 
of objects that are 2 or more levels deep in subfolders.</li><li>Disallow creating 
folders with the same name.</li><li>Disallow blank cells in rule_sets and other 
tables.</li><li>During rename, also change table column names and variables (in 
percents).</li><li>Allow the user to enter numbers with decimal point as question 
values used in formulas.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-18,19</h3><ul> <li>Fixed a large 
number of memory leaks and the use of some operators in tables.</li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-17</h3><ul> <li> Allow printing of the object/folder trees and object forms.</li><li>Allow 
the specification of goals when invoking a knowledgebase via the KWI.</li><li>Fixed 
'contains' and 'contains_nocase' comparators.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-16</h3><ul> 
<li>Fixed a variety of problems with moving/renaming objects and folders. </li></ul><h3>Version 
4-1-14</h3><ul> <li>Added Delphi runtime interface example.</li><li>Fixed 'default' 
to work like 'true' in rule_sets.</li><li> Fixed text objects that use files instead 
of text within the object itself.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-12</h3><ul> <li>Added 
a Tools | Preferences item to optionally save knowledgebases in Unicode format 
so that international characters can be used. This makes .kb files unreadable 
under Win98 editors like notepad, and UNICODE FILES WILL NOT WORK UNDER LINUX 
FOR THIS RELEASE.</li><li>Added Run | Compile command to compile knowledgebases 
for faster execution and for distribution. Compiled files end in .kbc. When running 
a knowledgebase in the Workshop the compiled form is run instead of the source 
form if the date of the compiled file is more recent than the date of the source 
file. When running a knowledgebase under the CGI interface, you can specify a 
.kbc file instead of a .kb for kb_file. When running an embedded knowledgebase 
under the KWI, you can open a .kbc file instead of a .kb.</li><li>When running 
knowledgebases, answers are returned as they are available, so the Workshop runs 
exactly the same way the KWI does (and hence the web, Java, Delphi and VB interfaces).</li><li>Added 
number_of_items to check the number of values in a list.</li><li>Automatically 
re-open last opened knowledgebase or prompt for one to open.</li><li>Remember 
more window sizes and locations between sessions.</li><li>Fixed HTML output window 
during run to not contain any spurious &lt;p&gt;'s.</li><li>Fixed various UI problems 
for Linux and built first Linux distribution.</li><li>Fixed bug that returned 
a bad value when no rows in a table match (now it properly displays an error message).</li><li>Fixed 
bug that ignored setting of auto-update status window.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-11</h3><ul> 
<li> Almost finished the Basic tutorial.</li><li>All Jigs: Added date handling 
and documented it.</li><li>All Jigs: Added output_top, continue and bottom to 
the knowledgebase object for formatting output to be displayed for the user.</li><li>Fixed 
a bug that caused the Workshop to GPF and exit when incorrect condition syntax 
was entered into a rule_set or table and saved.</li><li>Fixed the list of return 
types for SQL queries.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-10</h3><ul> <li>Converted to Amzi! 
6.1 for the underlying system. This uses double-quotes (&quot;) instead of dollar 
signs ($) to denote text strings. </li><li>Added Tools | Font command to set the 
font for the object/folder trees, status window and object edit windows.</li><li>All 
Jigs: Allowed variables in question prompts, with the restriction that ask-also 
questions must not contain any unknown variables.</li><li>Support Jig: Added solution_top 
and solution_bottom to format the output for the web.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-6</h3><ul> 
<li>Added Row | Insert Above command.</li><li>Renamed and reorganzed CGI files 
for better handling of multiple jigs.</li><li>When renaming objects, prompts to 
replace the name for all other occurances within the knowledgebase.</li><li>Fixed 
Search | Find to work when not matching case.</li><li>Fixed disappearing cursor 
when switching between object windows.</li><li>Support Jig: Added sendmail action 
to CGI interface.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-5</h3><ul> <li>Added the ability to 
specify two different text values for menus. One is used for display to the user 
and the other is used in conditions in rule_sets and tables.</li><li>Added Alt-keys 
for invoking menu choices and hot keys for the more commonly used menu commands.</li><li>Turned 
off the button panel on the bottom of the object window and allow object windows 
to be closed via the 'X' in the upper right corner.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-4</h3><ul> 
<li> <p>Added a Preferences option to turn off the automatic update of the status 
window. </p></li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-3</h3><ul> <li>Merged the document_format 
object with the knowledgebase object. You will be prompted when you open an old 
knowledgebase if it is OK to convert it to the new format. We recommend you make 
a backup copy of your knowledgebase first.</li><li>Re-organized view problems 
and connections onto status tabs at the bottom of the screen. Improved the reporting 
of both items.</li><li>Added a Search | Find command with its results displayed 
on the status tabs.</li><li>Reworked the CGI interface so that it will work with 
any jig.</li><li>Added a full source code Java runtime sample.</li><li>Small ease-of-use 
enhancements.</li></ul><h3>Version 4-1-2</h3><ul> <li>First public beta release.</li></ul><!-- #EndEditable -->

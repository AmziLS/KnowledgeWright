#
# amzi.cfg - Used to set various runtime parameters
# for Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server.
#
# Lines beginning with # are comments.
#
# To change a parameter, copy the line and
# change the value of the parameter.  The value in
# the commented line is the default value, unless
# otherwise noted.
#
# The Prolog engine looks for this file in either
# the current directory or the amzi config directory.
# Under Windows it finds that directory based on the
# location of amzi.dll.  Under Unix it uses the AMZI_DIR
# environment variable.
#
# So for running on the development machine, amzi.cfg
# will normally be found OK, but when you distribute an
# application, you must put amzi.cfg in the main directory
# of your distribution, if you need to set amzi.cfg
# parameters for that application.
#
# See documentation for details on the various parameters.

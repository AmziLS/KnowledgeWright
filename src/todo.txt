Enhancements version 4-3

- Add database action object to insert/update via ODBC

- Add analyze program.

- rippling ask_also

- Compile .jigs and load them

- Save results to a file for JSP.

- Status box does not display message saying it is xrefing...
  (must restructure code to do xref in a thread and lock ls)

- xref needs to identify objects in conditions

- OK to save dialog boxes not appearing (works with -classic).

- make a jig builder, actually, maybe the jig should
  go right in the .xpl and the .xpl becomes the jig!
  No, need alibless .xpls for that... :( r6.1... anyway
  jig builder should put a jig version as well in the
  .xpl and .jig that are in sync.

- fix jig version & convert, put a jig-version number
  in each knowledge object, and have convert code
  exist in the jig itself.

- SQL query multiple values returned.

- for national language, 'dictionary' objects, useful for menus:
  dictionary(colors, /, [
     table = [
       [code,   $English$, $Spanish$, $Japanese$],

       [red,    $red$,     $rojo$,    $akai$],
       [black,  $black$,   $negra$,   $kuroi$] ]
  ]).
